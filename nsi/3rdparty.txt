QMapShack for Windows (short: QMS) is build with Visual Studio 2013 as 64bit application
It depends on the 3rd party software listed below

1.) Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable Package
  The installer vcredist_x64.exe (ca 7MB size) as downloaded from
    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784
  is contained in the QLGT Installer package and may be executed if selected by the user.
  Note: Those runtime libraries may already be contained in Windows 7 or WIndows 8 installations.

2.) Qt5 runtime libraries
  The Qt DLL's are deployed in the QLGT installation directory. 
  They are part of the "Qt libraries for Windows (VS 2008)" package.
  This can be retrieved from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/windows-cpp-vs2008.

3.) The GDAL library, http://www.gdal.org/

4.) The PROJ library http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/
  
5.) Icons for the Windows Start Menu ==> We should get rid of them and use own icons
    kfm_home.ico has been created from the Nuvola 1.0 icon set (http://www.icon-king.com/projects/nuvola/)
	gdalicon.ico has been converted from gdalicon.png from the GDAL package
 

Additional tools for building and installing
============================================
- CMake 2.8, available at http://www.cmake.org/
- NSIS, available at http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page


Compile instructions - to be verified
====================

1.) Compile the GDAL library, http://www.gdal.org/
[Build instructions inspired by http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingOnWindows, http://dominoc925.blogspot.de/2013/03/build-64-bit-gdal-for-windows.html]
- Download the source code of the version 1.11 (or latest) from http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadSource and unzip
- In nmake.opt, adapt the following lines, according to your build environment [my settings are given as example]
  MSVC_VER=1800
  GDAL_HOME = "M:\lib\gdal"
  PYDIR   =	"C:\Python34"
  SWIG = D:\gdal111\swig.exe
  WIN64=YES
- From the start menu, enter the VS2013, x64 native command prompt
- nmake /f makefile.vc
- nmake /f makefile.vc devinstall

2.) Compile the PROJ library http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/
- Download the source code of the version 4.8 (or latest) from http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ and unzip
- In nmake.opt, adapt the following lines, according to your build environment [my settings are given as example]
  INSTDIR=M:\lib\PROJ
- From the start menu, enter the VS2013, x64 native command prompt
- nmake /f makefile.vc
- nmake /f makefile.vc install-all

3.) Install QT5.3 or later 
- Download and run the Qt5 Windows Online Installer from http://qt-project.org/downloads
  Install for VS2013, x64

4.) Get the QMapshack source from the repository, e.g. 
   hg clone https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack QMapShack  
Note: you might have to install TortoiseHG   
   
5.) Start the CMake GUI (you did install CMake before, didn't you)
- Configure 
  In the first run there will be errors. 
  Now enter the directories where you have installed Qt5, GDAL and PROJ.4 to the respective variables.
  After that, Configure again.  
- Generate

6.) Open the generated QMapShack.sln with VS2013
- Compile the Release Version

7.) Download the VC redistributable installer 
  from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784

8.) Create the installer by executing
- nsi/copyfiles.bat
  Note: In copyfiles.bat, you may have to adapt the directories where you have installed Qt5, GDAL and PROJ.4.
- nsi/QMapShack_Installer.nsi
