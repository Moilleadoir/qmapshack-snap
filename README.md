# qmapshack-snap
For generating a snap package of QMapShack.

**[QMapShack](https://bitbucket.org/maproom/qmapshack/wiki/Home)** is mapping program (successor to [QLandkarte GT](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Map_On_Garmin/QLandkarte)) which allows editing, creating, storing and visualising GPS data through a variety of map options. See the developer’s site for details.

I am not a developer of this program. This repo is just a stepping stone to get the code from the developer’s Mercurial repo into Launchpad so that a snap package can be generated (hopefull).

As of late August 2017, the standard Ubuntu repo for 16.04 contains version 1.5.1 while the latest stable version is 1.9.0.
